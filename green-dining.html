            Green Dining Finder is a location-based app for Earthday365 that
            helps people find sustainable restaurants in St. Louis. By using
            this app, people can dine exclusively at restaurants that are
            mindful of their environmental impact and sustainability practices.

          <h2>Ethical Design</h2>
          <p class="mb-4">
            Wanting to take on new challenges and keep my design skills sharp, I
            started searching for a new project. That’s when I stumbled upon
            Code for a Cause — a 48-hour hackathon focused on benefiting
            non-profits who don’t have the resources available to hire tech
            teams.
          </p>
          <p>
            The non-profit I chose to help was Earthday 365. Their goal from the
            hackathon was to build a mobile app that allows for restaurant
            diners and their club members to find the restaurants that they
            audit and certify for sustainability.

          <h2>Defining a Minimum Viable Product</h2>
          <p class="mb-4">
            The project statement Earthday365 outlined was ambitious for a
            weekend of work, to say the least. Given that the team was only made
            up of Earthday365 volunteers, one developer, and myself, we needed
            to limit the scope of this project to something we could build in a
            weekend.
          </p>
          <p>
            Being the only designer on the team, I was responsible for
            determining the vision of what we could build in one weekend,
            iterating and collaborating with the team on high fidelity mockups,
            and building a rich prototype for the developer to reference.

          <p class="mb-4">
            As a result of only having a weekend for this project, the
            volunteers of the team were the voices of users and were our main
            source of feedback. While it was not authentic user testing, the
            volunteers were aware of the needs of users from communicating and
            working with them regularly.
          </p>
          <p>
            Through iterative design and fast feedback, I was able to improve
            the earlier designs and start prototyping the final solution.

          <h2>The Challenges of a Hackathon</h2>
          <p class="mb-4">
            Even though we tried to limit the scope and features to something we
            could achieve in a single weekend, my team and I were not
            successful. We managed to get very close to a working product.
            However, quality assurance testing, bug fixing, and the submission
            process of getting into the app store prevented us from delivering
            within the constraints of our timeline.
          </p>
          <p>
            Since the hackathon, the team has continued to contribute on an
            ongoing basis. We still plan to see the project through and deliver
            the working product. As it stands, the project is complete and is
            going through the app store submission process.
