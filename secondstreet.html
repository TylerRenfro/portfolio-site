            Second Street is a successful start up based in St. Louis that specializes in promotion software and products. 
        </p>
        <p>I was hired to help Second Street with user experience design, user research, and usability testing for their thirteen different products and 1,700 daily active users.</p>

        <p class="mb-4">
            Although Second Street has been in business for 10 years, the company wasn't experienced when it came to user research and usability testing. When new features or updates were published, it was rare for us to measure the performance and check for design bugs. 
        </p>
        <p>
            To help prevent Second Street from skipping usability testing, I created a guide for conducting usability tests. This guide helped others on my team undestand the importance of usability testing to allow for our process to be updated so we could start validating features and benchmarking the user experience.

        <p class="mb-4">
            In order to create a process that integrated well the existing processes, I had to do some research on what would be best with our available resources. Since there wasn't stakeholder buyin yet, I had to use the tools Second Street already had.
        </p>
        <p>
            After reading what felt like endless Nielson Norman Group articles, I felt confident enough to experiment with some pilot studies. Utilizing Full Story and Delighted, I was able to come up with goals for usability studies and segment users sessions for moderation.

        <p class="mb-4">
            Now that the framework for conducting a usability test was complete, it was time to put it in action. I started out by benchmarking the setup process of a specifc promotion type.                     
        </p>
        <p class="mb-4">The main purpose of the study was to serve as an example of how Second Street could utilize usability testing to validate design decisions, measure updates, and discover insights. In order to make this a part of our regular processes, it needed to show a return on the investment of additional time and resources. Otherwise the stakeholders in the company wouldn't believe it's worth doing.</p>

        <p class="mb-4">
            Glancing at the data, it's honestly quite plain. However, one thing I started to notice was the amount of users who would throw errors when it when they would use date inputs. So I started tracking the amount of users who created errors in addition to the intial goals of the study. It turns out that 30% of users who created a promotion, encountered an error in the exact same place. 
        </p>
        <p class="mb-4">Following this insight, I decided to follow up with another usability study. This time, focusing specifically on the save states to figure out if I could find the reason so many users were having the same error.</p>

            <em>On this usability test I chose to do 40 sessions so I could have a sample size of 20 for each type of save. Turns out we could reduce the majority of user errors simply by implementing manual save for steps with dates.</em>

            Once I was able to demonstrate the value of remote unomderated usability testing, the company was accepting of adding it to our processes. In fact, we are discussing the possibilty of adding more advanced research methods for the product team. Going forward, I hope to help Second Street add A/B testing and moderated user testing to their ux toolbelt.
          </p>
          <p class="mb-4">I learned a lot developing this process within my organization. It was challenging to raise awareness of the importance of usability testing in the beginning, but once there were data and insights the team really started to come around. It felt rewarding to advance the process of the product team as well as help create more enjoyable experiences for users.</p>
